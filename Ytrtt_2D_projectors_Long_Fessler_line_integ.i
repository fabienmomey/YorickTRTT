   Ytrtt_2D_projectors.i is a module of TRTT code for creating tomographic
   projectors, given TOMOGRAPHIC and DATA OBJECTS. These projectors are used as
   h_evaluator which carry references to the objects containing calibration
   parameters to perform the projection, following the Radon transform
   principle, of an image of voxels values with compatible dimensions. One
   projector is related on a single acquisition at a given instant, that is to
   say a given position of the Source associated with a given position of the
   Detector plane and the Object of interest. Two models are available for the
   projectors:

   - The Separable B-spline model : TRTT code is mainly developped to use this
     model. It consists in taking separable B-splines of desired degree as basis
     functions for the representation of the function associated with the object
     of interest. The projection of such a function on a detector plane
     (footprint) is approximated by a separable b-spline suitably scaled with a
     magnification and distorsion factor (depending on the geometry of
     projection and the incidence of the X rays on the detector plane). This
     approximation is justified by the quasi-sphericity of a b-spline of
     sufficiently high degree, yielding separability whatever the axis and
     isotropic behaviour. This projector has been implemented in C language and
     interfaced with Yorick, so as to be efficient for iterative reconstruction
     algorithms.
     
   - The Distance Driven model, developped by DeMan & Basu (2004). It is based
     on a cubic voxel representation of the object of interest. The projection
     of a cubic voxel on the detector plane is performed by determining the
     projection of the axial section of the cubic voxel, and approximating the
     quadrilateral form of the footprint by a rectangle. This model is also more
     precise than other standard models such Ray Driven, but is highly
     anisotropic and will suffer from high reconstruction errors when the number
     of projections is limited.

   These projectors are the static part of the tomographic data
   modelization. For applications of Dynamic tomography, the object of interest
   becomes a sequence of 2D images, and data corresponds to a given instant of
   acquisition. Therefore we need an operator which determines the temporal
   slice that we are projecting. This operator is a time interpolator of the
   2D+t image, using b-spline interpolation (SPL library) for a good
   modelization of the continuity of the sequence in the "temporal"
   direction. It is combined with a static projector to make a "dynamic"
   projector. If we want to perform static tomography, we do not need such
   projector.

   This module allows to create sets of projectors, given a set of DATA objects
   corresponding for example to a rotation of the source around the object of
   interest (standard framework for tomography).
